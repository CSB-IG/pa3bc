# pa3bc - Pathway Analyses of Apoptosis and Autophagy on Breast Cancer

This repository's purpose is to document the methodogy used in the MSc project of Miguel Angel García-Campos, student in the Postgraduate in Biological Sciences, UNAM, México. And is linked to the OSF project [Integrative analysis of apoptotic related pathways: a systems biology approach][1]

The project seeks to search for insights into the functional relationships between the biological processes of apoptosis and autophagy in the tumorigenesis of breast cancer. Data to be analyzed consists in a dataset of 819 samples of primary breast cancer tissue, and 61 samples of healthy breast tissue. The microarray HG133A was used to asses the gene expression levels.

Validation datasets are provided as well in which results of subtype relationship with autophagy and apoptosis are as well observed.
